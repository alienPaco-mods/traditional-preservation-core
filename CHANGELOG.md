# Changelog: Traditional Preservation (Core)

## 0.1.0 (in development, not released)
- TP Core is now a mod that the TP mods require (`require=\TraditionalPreservationCore`). Its Lua moved from `lua/`
  to `42/media/lua/<side>/TraditionalPreservationCore/` and is loaded as `require "TraditionalPreservationCore/Weather"`
  (also `Station`, `UI`). Dairy and new mods (`tp new`) use it; Salt, Fish, Yeast and Vinegar keep a `tp sync` copy
  until they move over.
- `tp`: the core counts as a mod (`tp test Core`, `tp install Core`, which ships only `42/`); `tp sync` reads the new
  path and copies only into mods that still carry a copy; `tp new` no longer syncs a copy. The harness's
  `H.useModPaths()` also finds the core's Lua.
